This simulation generate Muons at 10TeV using MuonGun isometrically from the detector 10-string volume with a string separation of 80m. The Muons are injected at 80m from the edge of the detector. The photons are propagated with CLSim and the propagated photons go into the DOMLauncher module to finally go into the trigger algorithm.
