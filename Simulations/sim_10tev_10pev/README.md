This simulation generates Muon Neutrinos from 10 TeV to 10 PeV using LeptonInjector, then the photons are propagated by CLSIM through different geometries
of a 10 string cluster. The separation between strings varied from 50m, 60m, 70m, 80m, 90, 100m to 120m. The propagated photons go to the DOM Launcher Module,
to then go to the Trigger Algorithm. Finally, the events are weighted with LeptonWeighter to an Atmospheric + Astrophysical flux. 

The GCD files and particle cross section tables, can be obtained from the pone_offline repository, while the fluxes were generated with nuSQUIDS and nuflux.
